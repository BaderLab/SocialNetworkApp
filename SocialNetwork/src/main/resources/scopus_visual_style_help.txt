The Scopus visual style is designed for Scopus networks. Scopus networks typically lack institution information. As a result, no color coding is present in the default Scopus visual style. However Scopus networks do contain all the standard list of attributes found in Academia data-sets. Information on the total citation count and total co-publication count of each individual author is present and can be visualized via node size and edge width respectively.

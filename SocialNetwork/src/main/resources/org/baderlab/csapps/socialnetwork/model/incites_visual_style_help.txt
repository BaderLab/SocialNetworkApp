InCites networks are fully annotated. This means that in addition to the standard list of attributes typically found in Academia data-sets they also contain institution information. The InCites visual style works by matching institutions to their respective locations and color-coding them. Institutions for which no location has been found are classified as 'other' (purple). Location matching is determined locally and can be supplemented in the following way:<br> <b>Tools</b> - <b>InCites</b> - <b>Add institution</b>.

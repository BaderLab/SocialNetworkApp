InCites networks are fully annotated. This means that in addition to the standard list of attributes typically found in Academia data-sets they also contain institution information. The InCites visual style works by matching institutions to their respective locations and color-coding them. Institutions for which no location has been found are classified as 'other' (purple). Location matching is determined by a local map and as such may or may not b"e adequate.

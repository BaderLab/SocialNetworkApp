PubMed networks typically lack institution information. Thus, no color coding is present in the default PubMed visual style. However PubMed networks do contain all the standard list of attributes found in Academia data-sets. Information on the total citation count and total co-publication count of each individual author is present and can be visualized via node size and edge width respectively.
